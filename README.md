## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I learned to adjust my css to fit into a smaller screen size using the @media.



### Continued development

I want to keep using flexbox as it is the tool in CSS that I feel the most comfortable using. However, I do want to start using grid for later projects.



### Useful resources

- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) - I used openAI to clean up my CSS and HTML after I was finished with the project.
- [Mozilla Developer](https://developer.mozilla.org) - Mozilla Developer always comes in handy for when im stuck.
